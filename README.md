# Animating Ecology — Studio Ghibli Environmental Motifs

Welcome to the public-facing home of my independent project.  
Studio Ghibli films construct ecological meaning through repeated domain translations, where natural forces, spirits, and human infrastructures move into one another’s conceptual space. These translations generate a model of environmental thinking that is neither purely material nor purely animist, but relational.
