# Animating Ecology — Studio Ghibli Environmental Motifs

Welcome to the public-facing home of my independent project.  
This repository explores how *Studio Ghibli* films construct ecological imaginaries, with a focus on recurring environmental motifs.

# Week 05 Update
- Project Pages [index.html](https://github.com/Tangomango16/Animating_Ecology_Ghibli/blob/main/index.html) and [graphs.html]  
- [My Google Slides Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XI9mj5TQ_7FWa__S8rpM7C5VR3vcwPFz/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=106508322287824266158&rtpof=true&sd=true)
- Sources: Princess Mononoke, My Neighbor Totoro, Ponyo
- Environmental themes tracked: forests, rivers, pollution, animism, extinction, 

# Next Steps
