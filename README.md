# Animating Ecology — Studio Ghibli Environmental Motifs

Welcome to the public-facing home of my independent project.  
This repository explores how *Studio Ghibli* films construct ecological imaginaries, with a focus on recurring environmental motifs.

# Week 05 Update
- Project Pages [index.html] and [Image Archive]  
- Presentation [My Google Slides Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pEVvHcVW4qhRrM7ZRnXWl2RHjWWA_NlU/edit?slide=id.p1#slide=id.p1)
- Sources: Princess Mononoke, My Neighbor Totoro, Ponyo
- Environmental themes tracked: forests, rivers, pollution, animism, extinction, 

# Next Steps
- Complete coding of motifs across the three films 
- Create a landing page for the website 
- Create a network visualization of themes  
- Expand GitHub Pages into a more interactive project hub
